* Org-mode::org-fold branch

This branch is a re-implementation of org-mode folding mechanism hiding text using text properties instead of overlays. This should help with performance on large files.

Org-mode mailing list discussion: https://orgmode.org/list/87h7x9e5jo.fsf@localhost/

This repository is aiming to simplify testing of the branch. Feel free to open issues if you find bugs.
